This package implements [OPAQUE](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-opaque), an asymmetric password-authenticated
key exchange protocol that is secure against pre-computation attacks. It enables a client to authenticate to a server
without ever revealing its password to the server. 

This implementation is developed by one of the authors of the RFC [Internet Draft](https://github.com/cfrg/draft-irtf-cfrg-opaque).
The main branch is in sync with the latest developments of the draft, and [the releases](https://github.com/bytemare/opaque/releases)
correspond to the [official draft versions](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-opaque).

This package is continuously fuzzed on Fuzzbuzz.

#### What is OPAQUE?

> OPAQUE is a PKI-free secure aPAKE that is secure against pre-computation attacks. OPAQUE provides forward secrecy with
> respect to password leakage while also hiding the password from the server, even during password registration. OPAQUE
> allows applications to increase the difficulty of offline dictionary attacks via iterated hashing or other key
> stretching schemes. OPAQUE is also extensible, allowing clients to safely store and retrieve arbitrary application data
> on servers using only their password.
