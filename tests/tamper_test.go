package opaque

// todo: move all the tampering tests to this file
// todo: list the types of attacks covered
// todo: identify missing types of attacks
// todo: test attack using different contexts for client and server
// todo: replaying KE1/KE3 messages or reusing client/server state, which could allow session hijacking or key reuse attacks.
// todo: Identity binding and session binding – Tests focus on malformed keys and MACs but do not cover tampering with ClientIdentity, ServerIdentity, or nonces, leaving potential gaps in checking that identities are properly bound to the session.
