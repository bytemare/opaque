### Did you find a bug? üêû

* üîé Please ensure your findings have not already been reported by searching on the project repository under [Issues](https://github.com/bytemare/opaque).
* If you think your findings can be complementary to an existing issue, don't hesitate to join the conversation üòÉ‚òï
* If there's no issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/bytemare/opaque/issues/new). Please be clear in the title and description, and add relevant information. Bonus points if you provide a **code sample** and everything needed to reproduce the issue when expected behaviour is not occurring.
* If possible, use the relevant issue templates.

### Do you have a fix?

### Coding Convention

This project tries to be as Go idiomatic as possible. Conventions from [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go) apply here. Tests use a very opinionated linting configuration that you should use before committing to your changes.

### Governance Model

This project follows the [Benevolent Dictator Governance Model](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/benevolentdictatorgovernancemodel) where the project owner and lead makes all final decisions.

### Licence

By contributing to this project, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the project's [License](https://github.com/bytemare/opaque/blob/main/LICENSE).

All contributions (including pull requests) must agree to the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) version 1.1](https://developercertificate.org). It states that the contributor has the right to submit the patch for inclusion into the project.

Thanks! :heart:
